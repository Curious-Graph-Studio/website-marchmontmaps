  <p>
    Marchmont Maps is a new project created by Aneesh Naik, an astrophysicist-turned-map artist based in Marchmont, Edinburgh. After completing his PhD in astrophysics at the University of Cambridge, he pursued postdoctoral research at the University of Nottingham before moving to the University of Edinburgh as a Leverhulme Trust Early Career Research Fellow.

  <p>
    Aneesh later transitioned from studying distant galaxies to working on our own planet, joining the NatureTech company Space Intelligence, where he maps deforestation across the tropics.
  </p>

  <p>
    His artwork blends scientific precision with a love of place, transforming real geographic data into striking, colourful map art. He creates his work from his home studio in Marchmont.

    Marchmont Maps launched in Winter 2025 with one map: Edinburgh Kaleidoscope. This high-quality print is available for sale in Marchmont Gallery, or you can buy a print by contacting us directly.
